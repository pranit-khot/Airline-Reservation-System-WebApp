	“AIRLINE RESERVATION SYSTEM” web application provides options for viewing different flights available with different time for a particular date and provides customers with the facility to book a ticket, modify or cancel a particular reservation.

	The system allows the airline passenger to search for flights that are available between the two travel cities, namely the “Departure city” and “Arrival city” for a particular departure and arrival dates. 
	
	After search the system displays list of available flights with details such as flight no, name, price and number of seats available etc. and allows customer to choose a particular flight. Then the system checks for the availability of seats on the flight. If the seats are available then the system allows the passenger to book a seat. Otherwise passenger can take another flight.After successful reservation passenger will get ticket details like name of passenger,no. of seats booked and total fare via e-mail.

	Another part of sytem is the "Admin User" where admin can manage flight scheduling, availability of seats,adding and removing different routes and other functionalities.
